- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevinmckinley. My goal is to have customers use my software because they want to.
- 👀 I’m interested in making systems to help people more than pinching pennies to maximize profit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and improving my CSS in addition to my regular C# and JS development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on efforts that make life easier for people, especially engineers. I want to work hard to deliver an awesome product and experience. I like to work on systems where I hear from users if there's a problem rather than their lawyers. I like building internal or external tools, simplifying software lifecycles with CI/CD pipleines, and enabling system visibility (which led to me find ways to contribute to the OpenTelemetry project). I want to collaborate with people from different backgrounds because that's the best thing for the product and the world.
- 📫 How to reach me: my linkedin and gitub usernames are the same.
